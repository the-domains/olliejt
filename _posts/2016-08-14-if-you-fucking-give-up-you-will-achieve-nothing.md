If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing.

Never let your guard down by thinking you're fucking good enough. You won't get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, "When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it." You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn't going to get you anywhere. Design is all about fucking relationships---the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don't have it in you to succeed. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7bcb961-f220-4514-bab8-55b867c18b36.jpg)

Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations.
