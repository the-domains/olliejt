  Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and
  definitely in typography. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t
  the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work.
  You must overcome yourself. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas

Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. When you sit down to work, external critics aren't the enemy. It's you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn't going to get you anywhere. Form follows fucking function. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a474c45b-7259-4d28-ab9f-e901993a57db.jpg)

Never let your guard down by thinking you're fucking good enough. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Don't worry about what other people fucking think. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don't have it in you to succeed. Respect your fucking craft. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. If you're not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Practice won't get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. You won't get good at anything by doing it a lot
